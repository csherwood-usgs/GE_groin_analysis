# GE_groin_analysis - Summarize groin offset observations

I looked at all of the available Google Earth images for the reach extending from the Cape Cod Canal to the Sandwich Harbor groins.

For each image, I noted the date and assessed the assymetry of sand deposits around each of the groins. Evidence of transport was assessed on a qualitative scale as follows:

* -2 Strong asymmetry indicating westward transport
* -1 Asymmetry indicating westward transport
*  0 No asymmetry
*  1 Asymmetry indicating eastward transport
*  2 Strong asymmetery indicating eastward transport

The groins were numbered from east to west. Groins located near distinctive landmarks are as follows:

* 1 Near site of Horizon's restaurant


TODO: I could add in analysis of our 14 orthos.
